This is an extremely basic hyprland configuration.
Made for my own personal use.

In order to use this configuration, first do the following command in the terminal:
> git clone https://github.com/Uriel-Lorelei/answer.git

Then you can run the script by going to the answer directory and running:
> python3 setup.py

And that's it.
Although you may have to put your password mutiple times.

Make sure to use this configuration on fresh hyprland install for intended performance. Otherwise there may be conflict between configs.

This configuration uses waybar, mako, wofi, kitty, swayosd, ly, and nwg-look for configuration. 
Most of the configurations done are just basic changes and there are only few external additions.
Wallpapers are mostly from another pre-configuration of Hyprland called Hyde and others are my own addition found on the Internet.

The keybindings for this configuration are in 'keybindings.md'.
